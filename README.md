# simple-encryption
## Overview
**simple-encryption** is a basic encryption encryption interface that offers a simple and fun way to encode messages.

## Motivation and Features
I made this 61-line script as a "protest demonstration" project for my *Rhetoric1B* course at UC Berkeley in Fall 2016. The premise of the assignment was to protest a major injustice or vulnerability that everyday citizens are subject to and unaware of. In lieu of the massive email server breaches at the time, I created this script as a demonstration that normal users can utilize a simple interface to shallowly mask some of their sensitive email content as an extra layer of protection against mass man-in-the-middle attacks.

The script is composed of two main components:
- the encryption/decryption process
- the GUI design
